ZoomRead was created by Ifedolapo Shiloh Olotu in 2022 for the Congressional App Challenge.
The web app allows users to read and then quiz themselves on passages using various reading and quizzing modes.

## read modes
When reading a passage, the user can use the **Free-Read** mode, which allows the users to read at their own pace with a timer and WPM(Words-Per-Minute) tracker,

or they can use the **Speed-Read** mode, where the user can read at a set WPM to put their skills to the test!

## quiz modes
When quizzing themselves on a passage, the user has 4 modes for quizzing: **Summarize, Fill-In-The-Blank, Imposter, and Timeline**.

In the Summarize mode, the user can test their memory by trying their best to summarize the passage read.

In the Fill-In-The-Blank mode, the user is tested through unique algorithm-generated fill-in-the-blank questions.

In the Imposter mode, the user is presented with 2 versions of the same sentence and must discern which is the correct one.

And finally, in the Timeline mode, the user is presented with 3 sentences which they must rearrange into the correct order.

ZoomRead aims to be a one-stop-shop for all your reading needs! It utilizes various reading and quizzing modes to build up your reading speed and comprehension. Happy reading!
